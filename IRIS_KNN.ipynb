        "------------------\n",
        "The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species:\n",
        "Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features:\n",
        "- sepal length\n",
        "- sepal width\n",
        "- petal length\n",
        "- petal width\n",

        "predict the species of an iris flower given its measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methodology:\n",
        "------------\n",
        "We are using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. KNN is a **lazy learning algorithm**, meaning it does not build a model\n",
        "   during training. Instead, it stores all training samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. During **training**:\n",
        "   - The algorithm simply memorizes all training samples and their labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. During **testing/prediction**:\n",
        "   - For a new sample, KNN calculates the distance from this sample\n",
        "     to all stored training samples.\n",
        "   - It finds the K closest samples (neighbors).\n",
        "   - The predicted class is determined by **majority vote** among these neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "-----------\n",
        "- KNN is distance-based, so **feature scaling** is important.\n",
        "- KNN can predict **one sample at a time** or **multiple samples at once**.\n",
        "- Evaluation metrics include **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.\n",
